# Anthology Together 2023 Power Automate Workshop
This guide is designed to walk workshop participants through the various steps
of modeling a Power Automate workflow that communicates with Anthology Student
and Microsoft Teams. By the completion of the workshop, participants will have
completed a functional Power Automate workflow that can be initiated manually
or via the Anthology Student Workflow Engine. This workflow will accept parameters
which are used to query Anthology Student and initiate a approval workflow that
notifies a user via Microsoft Teams, prompts for their approval or disapproval, and then updates Anthology Student accordingly.
